# Responsive Portfolio Page
This is a web page featuring an **About Me**, a **Contact**, and a **Portfolio** page. It is aesthetically similar to [HW-1](https://github.com/twopcz/HW-1), but it has been remade using the Bootstrap CSS framework. Bootstrap enables responsive web design, allowing for control over how the page is displayed across various screen sizes. Responsive web design has become paramount to how users interact with the web since the popularity of smart phones has skyrocketed within the past decade. Learning how to create a responsive web page is extremely beneficial and important to a developer's skillset so that their content can be more accessible to their users. I had a lot of fun doing this page and it was more difficult than I thought it would be, but it was filled with many 'Aha!' moments.
